# Owl Mail by HooHacks
Owl Mail is a lightweight web application (built purely on the front-end with React + Node.js) that allows users to individually send pre-filled template emails to recipients defined in a local CSV through the JavaScript "mailto" command, which deploys the user's default mailing client.
